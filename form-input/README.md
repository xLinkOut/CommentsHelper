# HTML Version
It's the only working solution for now. Is an HTML page with two text input: one for the url of the post and another with the Graph API token. If all is correct, a jQuery/AJAX request get the comments in JSON, parse and organize them in a list. 
Features that can be implemented: download the comments in PDF/CSV or something similar; sort comments by id/alphabetic (by firstname/lastname of the user or by comment's content).
